    "summary": "Frontend Developer with 3 years of experience at Tata Consultancy Services, specializing in building responsive and scalable web applications using Angular (v17+), TypeScript, and NgRx. Proficient in micro front-end architecture, state management, and reusable UI component library development. Known for writing clean, maintainable code, optimizing performance, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality user experiences.",
    "aboutMe": "I'm a frontend developer based in Bengaluru with a strong focus on building modern, scalable web applications using Angular. I enjoy creating responsive user interfaces, implementing clean state management with NgRx, and working with micro frontend architectures using Native Federation. I’ve worked on enterprise-grade apps in the finance and healthcare domains, where I contributed to everything from reusable UI components to performance optimization. I’m always curious about how things work under the hood and love refining both the developer experience and the end-user experience. When I’m not coding, I’m either exploring new frontend trends, fine-tuning my personal projects, or helping others in the dev community."
